# Credo configuration.
#
# This is a trimmed version of `mix credo.gen.config` output: the generated file
# lists every check Credo ships, which reads as a checklist rather than as a
# decision. What is below is the set actually enforced, plus the handful of
# non-default checks this project wants.
#
# NOTE: Quokka reads this file (via `Credo.ConfigFile.read_or_default/2`) to
# decide which style rules to enforce when formatting. Changing a check here can
# therefore change how `mix format` rewrites code, not just what Credo reports.
